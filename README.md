***Rethinking water consumption with data-driven insights***


This data analysis was created as a capstone project for the [Data Analytics bootcamp training course at neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/data-analytics), which took place from November 2023 through March 2024.

This repository contains notebooks detailing data sourcing, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and draft visualizations of the data. Cleaned datasets were then uploaded into a PostgreSQL database and queried from there. The final visualizations and graphs were prepared using Tableau. The final presentation of the data analysis, which was held on March 1, 2024, is also included.

The final data analysis encourages the use of tap water instead of bottled water by providing comparisons of water quality data and costs, revealing personal convenience as a main factor behind the increasing consumption of bottled water.

## Project Background

The aim was to shed light on the ever-growing sales of bottled water, especially in countries where tap water quality and living standards are high.

Due to the abundance of official data available, the United Kingdom was chosen as a case study region.

Furthermore, information on tap water quality was obtained from the website of Anglian Water Services Ltd., a water supply company operating in the eastern part of England.

## Technical Information

Most data was obtained online through 'traditional' methods such as direct downloads, APIs, and some web scraping.

Another substantial part of the analysis project, namely the tap water quality data, was extensively obtained and computed using web driver and web scraping libraries.
